# brainfuck-interpreter
A simple brainfuck interpreter written in rust I wrote whilst at LCA 2020.  
Some things I would like to add if I get around to it is some sort of validation of brainfuck code like making sure all square brackets are matched, thats the only thing I can think of to check for currently.  

    Usage:
    brainfuck-interpreter test/test.bf

for a bunch of programs written in brainfuck to use look at:
https://github.com/fabianishere/brainfuck/tree/master/examples

or to get a generate brainfuck program that prints out what you want, then go here: 
https://copy.sh/brainfuck/text.html

I particularly like https://github.com/fabianishere/brainfuck/blob/master/examples/asciiart/asciiart.bf
